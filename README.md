# Integrated Circuits Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to design, simulate, and analyze a highly efficient, low-power master-slave D flip-flop using Gate Diffusion Input (GDI) logic,
implemented in a 22nm CMOS process. The design leverages the GDI technique to minimize transistor count,
reduce power consumption, and decrease propagation delay compared to conventional CMOS flip-flops.
